# Text-Game

A fun little project I am working on. It is a text-based adventure game that tells a story and adapts based on the user's input.

The project is mainly composed of string outputs/input. However I implemented classes to handle various rooms the player encounter's as well as used an array to manage the players 'inventory'. It is still in progress and perhaps I may need to work on my story telling skills to try and make this better.
